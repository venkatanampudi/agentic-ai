    "### Router Definition in Agentic AI:\n",
    "##### In Agentic AI, a router is a decision-making component that directs a task, message, or request to the right agent, tool, or workflow based on intent, context, or rules.Think of it like a traffic controller for agents\n",

    "#### Why routers are important in Agentic AI ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic systems usually have:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple agents (planner, coder, researcher, security agent, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple tools (search, database, APIs, scanners)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple paths (retry, escalate, summarize, handoff)\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a router, everything goes to one agent → inefficient and brittle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a simple agent graph where the chat model routes between a direct response or a tool call based upon the user input. In a simple agent graph, where the LLM is directing the control flow either by calling a tool or just responding directly.\n"
