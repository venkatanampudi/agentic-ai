    "### LangGraph \n",
    "##### LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs used to create agent and multi-agent workflows. LangGraph is built by LangChain Inc, but can be used without LangChain. It follows DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)\n",
    "* LangGraph powers the production grade agents\n",
    "* LangGraph provides fine-grained control over both the flow and state of your agents applications. It implements a central persistence layer, enablibng features that are common to most agent architectures.\n",
    "* Memory: LangGraph persists arbitrary aspects of your application's state, supporting memory of conversations and other updates within and across user interactions\n",
    "* Human-in-the-loop: Because state is checkpointed, execution can be interrupted and resumed, allowing for decisions, validations, and corrections at key stage via human point.\n",

    "#### LangGraph Components:\n",
    "* Nodes: Every node have some kind of functionality\n",
    "* Edges : The relation between nodes \n",
